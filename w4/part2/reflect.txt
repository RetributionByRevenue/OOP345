 /*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
 that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

In this lab I learned how to work with compositions and aggregations. I had to go back and review how to write a move constructor and copy constructor in this lab. 
These two functions were needed for my code because the main function required it. In general this lab wasn't very difficult but I did have some mild troubles with
creating memory and figuring how to deallocate it without deleting the memory twice. 
1) the difference between the implementations of a composition and an aggregation:
Composition is where two classes have a "part-of" relationship which results in both being dependant on the other. 
Once one of the entities reaches the end, the other does too. 
Implementation: we allocate a class within another class. When the "parent" class ends/deconstructs, the "child" class
will disappear as well because without its "parent" class, the child class doesn't exist. 


An Aggregation however, is a "has-a" relationship. Either entity is able to be independant of one another. Therefore,
when one class ends, the other class is still able to continue. 
Implementation: we allocate a class outside of another class and then passes a pointer to the "parent" class. Since the
two classes are independant of each other, even when we deallocate/deconstruct the "parent" class, the "child" class object
still exists and is able to continue functioning. 

2) the difference between the implementations of move and copy functions in a composition and an aggregation.
Composition: copy and move function will be responsible for allocating and destroying the resources (destroying the resource only works for the move)
Aggregation: copy and move function are not responsible for allocating and destroying the resources. It will only copy/move the pointer.
